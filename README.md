## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

In addition, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

You can also watch bite-sized lessons with real-world projects on [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a Laravel application from scratch while learning PHP fundamentals.

## Agentic Development

Laravel's predictable structure and conventions make it ideal for AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Install [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/docs/ai) to supercharge your AI workflow:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev

php artisan boost:install
```

Boost provides your agent 15+ tools and skills that help agents build Laravel applications while following best practices.

## Project setup & deployment notes

These notes help prepare the project for GitHub and deployment (e.g. Render).

1. GitHub preparation
    - Ensure your local repository is initialized and `.gitignore` includes at least:
        - `.env`, `/vendor`, `/node_modules`, `/public/storage`, and build artifacts.
    - Do NOT commit your `.env` file. Instead create and commit a `.env.example` with placeholder values (one already exists).

2. Storage and uploaded images
    - Uploaded blog images are stored on the `public` disk (storage/app/public/blogs).
    - During local development and deployment you must create the storage symlink that makes these files publicly accessible:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

    - After that uploaded images will be available under `public/storage/blogs/...` and URLs generated via `Storage::url($path)` or the model accessor `image_url` will point to `APP_URL/storage/blogs/...`.

3. Render deployment checklist
    - Create a new Web Service on Render and push this repository.
    - In Render's environment variables, set `APP_ENV`, `APP_KEY`, `APP_URL` (your Render URL), database variables, `FILESYSTEM_DISK=public`, and any credentials (mail, AWS) required.
    - Build and start commands typically:

Build command:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
npm ci && npm run build # if you use Vite assets
```

Start command (Render web service):

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan storage:link
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t public public/index.php
```

4. Notes
    - The app uses the `image_url` attribute on the Blog model which returns absolute URLs for remote images or `Storage::url()` for files stored on the `public` disk. Use `{{ $blog->image_url }}` in views to ensure correct paths.
    - Ensure `APP_URL` is set in production so `Storage::url()` returns correct absolute URLs.
    - Keep `.env` out of version control. Use Render's Environment settings to configure secrets.
